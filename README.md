## Dataset

The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total. However, I used only datasets from 2005 to 2008 due to the magnificent size of the datasets. The combined datasets constitute over 28.74 million flight records in the US from 2005 to 2008. It has much detailed information, such as specific information about times of flights, delays and cancellations, airline companies, and destinations.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration section, I discovered that carriers canceled more flights than the other reasons in the datasets: weather, NAS, and Security. I have also found that there were more flight cancellations related to the weather during the winter months (Dec, Jan, and Feb). 

I have also discovered that Orlando airport dominated all the airports in the entire dataset regarding departure and arrival delays.

Furthermore, I found out that there was a moderate positive correlation between late aircraft, NAS, weather, carrier delays, and arrival delays. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

My main focus on the presentation was on the cancellations and the delays of the flights that were related to different factors, such as departure and destination airports, sources of delays and cancellations, times of the year, and carriers.
