## Dataset

The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total. However, I used only datasets from 2005 to 2008 due to the magnificent size of the datasets. The combined datasets constitute over 28.74 million flight records in the US from 2005 to 2008. It has much detailed information, such as specific information about times of flights, delays and cancellations, airline companies, and destinations.
